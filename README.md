# Advent of Clojure

My [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) Solutions in Clojure.

I will be solving these coding challenges as they are posted and will
update this repo.

To have the most fun possible, solve these challenges on your own before
looking at these solutions.

See the [`src/advent`](https://github.com/arronmabrey/advent-of-clojure/tree/master/src/advent) directory for the solutions.

See the [`doc`](https://github.com/arronmabrey/advent-of-clojure/tree/master/doc)
directory for the problem statements.
